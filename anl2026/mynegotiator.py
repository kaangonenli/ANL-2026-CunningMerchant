"""
CunningMerchant — A competitive agent for ANL 2026 (Automated Negotiation League).

ANL 2026 is a bilateral negotiation with a DECEPTION challenge. The agent's final
score has two components:
    Score = Advantage + Concealing
where:
    Advantage = (utility_of_agreement - reservation_value) / (max_utility - reservation_value)
    Concealing = how well we MISLEAD the opponent's model of our utility function
                 (measured by Kendall rank correlation — lower correlation = higher concealing score)

Strategy Overview:
    1. Aggressive Anchoring (Opening Move): Holds ground firmly with an elevated threshold 
       during the initial 15% of the negotiation to probe opponent concession rates.
    2. Aspiration-based Concession: Follows a strict time-dependent Boulware curve (e=4.0) 
       to project a tough, unyielding posture throughout the mid-game.
    3. Haggling Fluctuation (Zig-zag Strategy): Injects controlled, high-frequency utility 
       vibrations into bids to disrupt and dismantle the opponent's curve-fitting or 
       linear regression models.
    4. Active Preference Inversion (Throw a curve): Misleads the opponent by offering suboptimal 
       values on our highly critical issues while maximizing utility on irrelevant issues, 
       effectively flipping our apparent preference profile.
    5. Opponent Frequency Modeling & Trend Tracking: Utilizes frequency analysis for 
       issue estimation and real-time linear regression to monitor opponent pacing.
    6. Adaptive Last-Minute Compromise (Merchant Panic): Dynamically collapses acceptance 
       thresholds in the final 2.5% of rounds to guarantee a deal and completely eliminate 
       timeout risks.
